# Auto-Key Press Script

This script automatically presses and holds the "F" key until the "G" key is pressed, at which point it stops.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need Python installed on your machine along with the `pyautogui` and `keyboard` libraries. If you don't have these libraries, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pyautogui keyboard


How to Use
Run the script.
You have 3 seconds before the script begins to automatically press and hold the "F" key.
Stopping the script:
To stop the script and release the "F" key, press the "G" key.
If you need to stop the script manually for any reason, you can do so by interrupting the script execution (e.g., pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal).
Note
This script is designed for demonstration purposes. Please use it responsibly and ensure that automatic key pressing does not interfere with system operations or violate any software terms of use.
